# Fortuna Connector

This is a connector that plugs a Raspberry Pi to a board, and can be used to:
 - Have a Raspberry Pi programming multiple microcontroller types in the board (AVR, ARM, etc.)
 - Debug protocols in the board using the Raspberry Pi (UART, SPI, IÂ²C, SWD)

The connector contains:
 - A female header to connect to the Raspberry Pi GPIOs
 - A male header to connect the Raspberry Pi to the board using a flat cable.
 - A male and female header to help debug any problems in communication (for example, using a digital analyzer)
 - A button to turn on/off power from the Pi to the board.
 - LEDs indicating power and activity in the protocols.

## Software

A few sample project skeletons are provided in the package.

The Makefile needs to be configured to choose the correct MCU, speed, etc.. The following `make` commands are available:

- `make`: compile source code
- `make size`: print size of executable generated for the MCU
- `make test-connection`: test if communication with the MCU is working
- `make fuse`: program fuses (AVR only)
- `make upload`: upload executable to the MCU
- `make talk`: opens a serial connection from the computer to the MCU
- `make clean`: delete the intermediate files generated

A program called `reset` is also made available that simply resets the MCU.
